# Album Artwork Recommendation
A huge part of my music choices stem from the album cover. For me a good album cover augments the listening experience greatly, and is usually the first thing I look at when out hunting for new music.

Historically speaking, the album cover has been a marketing tool for record
companies and artists to sell music. As streaming platforms and online music services have grown in size, the utility of the album cover has diminished. From a personal standpoint, I am always looking for music that fits my tastes sonically and visually. While services like Spotify have great recommendation engines in place to serve the former, there isn't anything readily available to serve the latter.

As a quick test, I decided to create a program that could recommend you albums with similar visual aesthetics based on an queried album. There are three different scripts on this repo, one for scraping albums, extracting features, and recommending new albums.
